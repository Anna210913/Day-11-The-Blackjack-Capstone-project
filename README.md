# Day 11: Blackjack Project
## About the Project

On Day 11, we built a **Blackjack game**.  
Try to hit **21** and not go over. If you go over, you lose. If your opponent (the computer) is closer to 21 than you, the computer wins. Simple, classic, fun!

## What We Learned
- Writing **functions** to keep code organized and reusable
- Using **lists** to store and manage cards
- Using the **random module** to deal cards
- Applying **conditional logic** to check game rules and decide winners
- Using **loops** to keep the game running until the player decides to stop
- Returning values from functions and updating program state

## How the Code Works

- Cards are randomly dealt from a list of values.
- Functions handle **dealing cards**, **calculating scores**, and **deciding winners**.
- You choose whether to draw another card or pass.
- The computer plays automatically until it reaches a minimum score.
- At the end, the game shows both hands and declares the winner.


This project strengthened my understanding of functions, game logic, loops, and condition handling. This is building my confidence in structuring interactive Python programs.
